# Where To Go Next? A Hybrid Travel Recommender
---
Travel histories for over 3000 individual users and descriptions of 1000+ different cities were scraped from Nomadlist and Wikivoyage to create a travel recommendation system. The model utilized both collaborative and content-based filtering to create unique, hybrid recommendations that will be much more useful than your typical blog search.

**Techniques/Tools used in this project were:**
- BeautifulSoup and Selenium for web-scraping
- NLP for text processing
- Dimensionality Reduction
- Pairwise Cosine Distances
